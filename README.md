# Mega-Model-Pack
This is a project I have to recreate every single prop used on every single map in Teardown.  This list will update as i update the mod and add more models. Right now there are more than 2800 models! 2866 to be exact. Credit me if you'd like too, the models aren't mine. But you can credit either me or Tuxedo Labs.
